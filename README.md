## üí° Project Philosophy & Learnings

This portfolio was built as a project in itself, guided by several key principles:

-   **Mastering the Fundamentals:** By intentionally avoiding large frameworks like React or Angular for this project, I focused on strengthening my core skills in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, which are the foundation of all web development.

-   **Attention to Detail:** From the custom favicon set to the smooth-scrolling behavior and the active navigation link highlighting, every detail was considered to create a polished, professional final product.

-   **Show, Don't Just Tell:** The best way to demonstrate skills is to put them into practice. This portfolio serves as a live demonstration of my ability to build clean, functional, and aesthetically pleasing web applications from the ground up.
